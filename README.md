## Example
See the examples folder.
There lies a crawler which tries to find Hitler's Wikipedia article
by navigating from article to article, using the links in them.
You know, the classic [clicks to Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game) game.

To try out the example,
clone this respository,
cd into it,
run `npm install && npm run build` then `node examples/clicks-to-hitler.js Barack_Obama`.
(At the time of writing, you can get there with two clicks.)
